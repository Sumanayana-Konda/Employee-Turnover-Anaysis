# Project: Employee Turnover Analysis and Retention Program

## Summary:
Successfully analyzed employee turnover data for a company with approximately 15,000 employee records. Identified key insights and provided recommendations to management on reducing employee turnover. Developed a data story using Excel and PowerPoint, employing various techniques such as Pivot Tables, Power Query, DAX, and visualizations including Stacked Bar, Boxplot, Funnels, and Pie Charts.

## Key Achievements:
1. Quantified the overall churn rate of the company at 24%, indicating a potential issue compared to the industry average of 12-15%.

2. Identified three departments with the highest churn rates as potential candidates for a pilot retention program: Technical (26% churn, 18% of employees), HR (29% churn, 5% of employees), and Accounting (26% churn, 5% of employees).

3. Discovered a correlation between salary ranges and department churn rates. Found that departments with the most churn also had the highest number of employees in the low salary range. High and medium salary ranges showed greater employee retention.

4. Analyzed the impact of long working hours on churn rates and identified the Technical department as having the highest number of employees (11%) working more than 267 hours per month. This department should be prioritized for the pilot program.

5. Provided insights into the representation of departments with high churn rates within the company, emphasizing the need to evaluate recruitment difficulties in these departments.

6. Presented surprising observations regarding the distribution of churn across different departments, highlighting HR, Accounting, and Technical departments as the most affected by churn.

7. Leveraged data visualizations such as stacked bars, boxplots, funnels, and pie charts to effectively communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

## Skills Applied:
- Data analysis and hypothesis formulation
- Data storytelling using Excel and PowerPoint
- Pivot Tables, Power Query, and DAX calculations for aggregations (Mean, Median, Sum, Count, Percentile)
- Visualization techniques including Stacked Bar, Boxplot, Funnels, and Pie Charts

By applying these skills and delivering actionable insights, contributed to the development of an employee retention program aimed at reducing turnover and improving the company's overall employee satisfaction and retention metrics.
